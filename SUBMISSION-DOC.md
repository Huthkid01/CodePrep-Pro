# Project Description Document

## ● Project Name
**CodePrep Pro**

---

## ● Problem Statement
Software developers preparing for technical interviews often struggle to find quality coding problems in one place, practice under time pressure to simulate real interview conditions, and track their progress over time. There is a lack of accessible, all-in-one platforms that provide structured coding challenges with immediate feedback and progress tracking. CodePrep Pro solves this problem by providing a comprehensive technical interview preparation platform with 15+ LeetCode-style challenges, a built-in timer system, real code editor, and persistent progress tracking.

## ● Target Users
- Software developers preparing for technical interviews
- Computer science students practicing algorithms and data structures
- Junior developers looking to improve their problem-solving skills
- Anyone wanting to practice coding under timed interview conditions
